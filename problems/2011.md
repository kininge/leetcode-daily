# 🧩 Problem #2011 – Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** `Simulation`, `String`  
**Link:** [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/final-value-of-variable-after-performing-operations/)

---

### 🧠 Intuition  
The problem looks wordy, but it’s as simple as counting pluses and minuses.  
There are only *two* meaningful operations:
- `"++X"` and `"X++"` → increment `X` by `+1`
- `"--X"` and `"X--"` → decrement `X` by `-1`

The pre/post position of `X` doesn’t matter because there’s no dependency between operations.

---

### 💡 Approach  
1. Initialize `x = 0`.  
2. Loop through every operation in the array:  
   - If it contains `"++"`, increment `x`.  
   - Otherwise, decrement `x`.  
3. Return the final value of `x`.

This is a straightforward **O(n)** simulation problem.

### 🧩 Code  
```Typescript []
// ++X and X++ are same
// --X and X-- are same
// technically, there are only 2 operations
function finalValueAfterOperations(operations: string[]): number {
    let x:number = 0;
    for(const operation of operations)
        x += (operation === "++X" || operation === "X++") ? 1 : -1;
    return x;
};
```

### ⏱️ Complexity

**Time:** `O(n)` – one pass over all operations
**Space:** `O(1)` – constant memory used

ðŸ§© 3541. Find Most Frequent Vowel and Consonant

## ðŸ’¡ Hint (tiny nudge)
Count frequencies of each letter, track the max for vowels and consonants separately â€” you can do it in one pass.

---

## ðŸ§  Intuition
We only need the single most frequent vowel and the single most frequent consonant. Since the alphabet is tiny (26 letters), counting occurrences and taking the max is optimal and simple.

---

## âœ… Approach â€” Count then max (clean, readable)
1. Use an array of size 26 to count occurrences of each lowercase letter.
2. Iterate counts: keep `vowelMax` for vowels and `consonantMax` for consonants.
3. Return `vowelMax + consonantMax`.

This is `O(n)` time and `O(1)` extra space (26-size array).

```javascript []
var maxFreqSum = function(s) {
  const vowels = new Set(['a','e','i','o','u']);
  const freq = new Array(26).fill(0);
  let vMax = 0, cMax = 0;

  for (const ch of s) {
    const idx = ch.charCodeAt(0) - 97;
    freq[idx]++;
    if (vowels.has(ch)) vMax = Math.max(vMax, freq[idx]);
    else cMax = Math.max(cMax, freq[idx]);
  }

  return vMax + cMax;
};
```

## ðŸ“Š Complexity

- Time: `O(n)` where n = s.length.
- Space: `O(1)` extra (26-sized array).

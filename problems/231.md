## 💡 Problem Understanding
We need to determine if a given integer `n` is a power of two.

**Key Insight:**  
A number is a power of two if it has **exactly one set bit** in its binary representation.

---

## 🔍 Approach 1 — Divide Until Odd  
**Idea:**  
If `n` is a power of two, dividing it repeatedly by 2 will eventually lead to 1 without any remainder.  

**Complexity:**  
- Time: $$O(logN)$$ — Each division by 2 halves the number.  
- Space: $$O(1)$$  

```javascript []
  var isPowerOfTwo = function(n) {
      if (n === 0) return false;
      while ((n % 2) === 0) {
          n = Math.floor(n / 2);
      }
      return n === 1;
  };
```

## 🔍 Approach 2 — Keep Only Rightmost Set Bit (n & -n) 
**Idea:**

- In two's complement, `-n` flips bits of `n` and adds `1`.
- `n & (-n)` keeps only the rightmost set bit.
- If `n` is a power of two, it has only one set bit — so `n & (-n)` should equal `n`.

**Complexity:**
- Time: $$O(1)$$
- Space: $$O(1)$$

```javascript []
   var isPowerOfTwo = function(n) {
        if (n <= 0) return false;
        return (n & -n) === n;
    };
```

## 🔍 Approach 3 — Unset Rightmost Set Bit (n & (n-1))
**Idea:**

- `n & (n-1)` unsets the rightmost set bit.
- If n is a power of two, it has exactly one set bit, so `n & (n-1)` should be `0`.

**Complexity:**
- Time: $$O(1)$$
- Space: $$O(1)$$

```javascript []
var isPowerOfTwo = function(n) {
    if (n <= 0) return false;
    return (n & (n - 1)) === 0;
};
```

## 🔍 Approach 4 — Math (Log Base 2)
**Idea:**

- If `n` is a power of two, `log₂(n)` is an integer.

**Complexity:**
- Time: $$O(1)$$
- Space: $$O(1)$$

```javascript []
var isPowerOfTwo = function(n) {
    if (n <= 0) return false;
    return Number.isInteger(Math.log2(n));
};
```

## 🔍 Approach 5 — Count Set Bits
**Idea:**

- Loop through all bits and count set bits.
- If exactly `1` set bit → Power of two.

**Complexity:**
- Time: $$O(32)$$ = $$O(1)$$ for 32-bit integer
- Space: $$O(1)$$

```javascript []
var isPowerOfTwo = function(n) {
    if (n <= 0) return false;
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 32; i++) { 
        if ((n & (1 << i)) > 0) count++;
        if (count > 1) break;
    }
    return count === 1;
};
```

## 🏆 Best Choice
- Bit Manipulation `(n & (n - 1))` is the cleanest and fastest in practice.
- `n & -n` is equally efficient and often used in low-level programming.

## Key Takeaway:

Powers of two have only one set bit in their binary form — leverage that!

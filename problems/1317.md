## 🧠 Intuition  
We need to split `n` into two positive integers `(a, b)` such that:  
- `a + b = n`  
- Neither `a` nor `b` contains the digit `0`.  

Since `n ≤ 10^4`, a simple brute-force is sufficient.  

---

## 💡 Approach — Brute Force Search  

1. Define a helper `isNoZero(num)` that checks whether a number contains digit `0`.  
2. Iterate `i` from `1` to `n-1`:  
   - Let `a = i`, `b = n - i`.  
   - If both `a` and `b` are no-zero integers, return `[a, b]`.  
3. The problem guarantees at least one solution, so this always succeeds.  

```javascript
var getNoZeroIntegers = function(n) {
    function isNumberHaveZero(N) {
        while (N > 0) {
            if (N % 10 === 0) return true;
            N = Math.floor(N / 10);
        }
        return false;
    }

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (!isNumberHaveZero(i) && !isNumberHaveZero(n - i)) {
            return [i, n - i];
        }
    }
};
```

## 📊 Complexity

- Time: `O(n × d)`, where d = number of digits (~4 for 10^4). At most ~40k digit checks.
- Space: `O(1)`.

## 🔍 Notes

- Multiple valid answers are possible; any [a, b] works.
- A slightly faster trick: start from a=1, check until found. Since numbers like 1,2,3,... rarely contain zero, it usually resolves very quickly.
- Could also solve by digit construction (avoid 0s directly), but brute force is simplest given constraints.

# ðŸ§© Problem #898 - Bitwise ORs of Subarrays

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topics:**  `Array`, `Bit Manipulation`, `Hash Map`  
**Link:** [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-ors-of-subarrays/description/)

## ðŸ§  Intuition

- Any array of size $$n$$ has $$\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$$ **subarrays**.
- We can generate all subarrays in $$O(n^2)$$ time using nested loops. However, the input size is up to $$5 \times 10^4$$, so an $$O(n^2)$$ approach is not feasible.
- Naturally, I considered whether an $$O(n \log n)$$ or even $$O(n)$$ solution might be possible.
- For $$O(n \log n)$$, I explored ideas like **binary search** or **heaps**, but those don't apply here â€” we can't skip any subarrays, we must process all.
- For $$O(n)$$, I thought of a **prefix OR**, similar to prefix sum. Unfortunately, bitwise OR is not reversible. Once a bit is set, we canâ€™t "unset" it â€” so we can't subtract prefix values like in sums.
- However, one useful constraint: since the maximum value for `arr[i]` is $$10^9$$, only up to **32 bits** can be set in any number. This limits the number of unique OR results.



## ðŸš€ Approach

- Since an $$O(n)$$ or $$O(n \log n)$$ direct solution isnâ€™t straightforward, I decided to **optimize the $$O(n^2)$$ subarray generation**.
- In a brute-force approach, youâ€™d calculate all subarrays using nested loops:

- I was inspired by the concept of the **Frontier Set** (often used in robotics/pathfinding algorithms). The idea is:

> If we know all OR results of subarrays ending at the previous element, we can build the OR results of subarrays ending at the current element.

- For each element:
  - Start a new subarray with just that element.
  - Extend all previous subarrays by OR-ing them with the current element.

- Because the number of **unique OR values** at any point is at most `32`, our total time complexity becomes:

> $$O(32 \cdot n) = O(n)$$

- Space complexity is also optimized because we only store a small set of intermediate OR values at each step.



## ðŸ§® Algorithm

We maintain:

- A `Set` called `ans` to store **all distinct OR results** across all subarrays.
- A `Set` called `ansSoFar` to keep track of the OR results of subarrays ending at the previous element.
- A temporary `Set` called `current` to compute OR results for subarrays ending at the current element.

### Steps:

1. For each `num` in `arr`:
    - Initialize `current` with `{num}` (subarray of length 1).
    - For each value in `ansSoFar`, compute `num | value` and add it to `current`.
    - Add all values in `current` to the final result set `ans`.
    - Update `ansSoFar = current`.


## ðŸ“ˆ Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:  
  $$O(n \cdot W)$$ where $$W \leq 32$$ (number of bits in max value), so effectively $$O(n)$$.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  $$O(n)$$ for the final answer set. At any step, we store only $$O(32)$$ intermediate values.

## âœ… Code

```javascript []
var subarrayBitwiseORs = function(arr) {
    const ans = new Set(); // stores all unique ORs
    let ansSoFar = new Set(); // ORs of subarrays ending at previous index

    for (const num of arr) {
        const current = new Set();
        current.add(num); // start new subarray with just this element

        ansSoFar.forEach(prev => {
            current.add(num | prev); // extend each previous OR
        });

        current.forEach(value => ans.add(value)); // add to final result
        ansSoFar = current; // update for next iteration
    }

    return ans.size;
};
```

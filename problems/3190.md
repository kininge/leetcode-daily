## 📝 Problem Summary

You are given an integer array `nums`.

In one operation, you can **add 1** or **subtract 1** from any element of `nums`.

Your task is to find the **minimum number of operations** needed to make **every element** in `nums` divisible by 3.

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 50`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`

---

## 💡 Intuition (hint first)

Think in terms of **modulo 3**.

For any number `x`, only three cases exist:

- `x % 3 == 0` → already divisible → 0 operations
- `x % 3 == 1`
- `x % 3 == 2`

Question:  
For `x%3 == 1` or `2`,  
How many `+1` or `-1` moves do we need to reach a multiple of 3?

Try a few:

- `1 → 0` or `1 → 2 → 3`
- `2 → 3` or `2 → 1 → 0`
- `4 → 3` or `4 → 5 → 6`
- `5 → 6` or `5 → 4 → 3`

In every case, you can always fix it in **exactly 1 move**.

So for each element:

- If `num % 3 == 0` → cost `0`
- Otherwise → cost `1`

## 🍃 Approach – Direct Modulo Logic

### Key observation

For any integer `x`:

- `x % 3 == 0` → already good → cost `0`
- `x % 3 == 1` → nearest multiple of 3 is `x - 1` → cost `1`
- `x % 3 == 2` → nearest multiple of 3 is `x + 1` → cost `1`

There’s no scenario where you need more than 1 operation for a single number.

So the total answer is:

```text
sum over all nums:
    0 if num % 3 == 0
    1 otherwise
```

That’s it.

**Algorithm**

  1. Initialise steps = 0.
  2. For each num in nums:
    - If num % 3 != 0, increment steps by 1.
  3. Return steps.

### 🧾 Code (TypeScript)

```ts
function minimumOperations(nums: number[]): number {
    let steps = 0;

    for (const num of nums) {
        if (num % 3 !== 0) steps += 1;
    }

    return steps;
}
```

### ⏱️ Complexity

- We perform one constant-time operation per element.
- No extra data structures.

**Time:**  `O(n)` where n = nums.length
**Space:** `O(1)`

## 🧠 Intuition

We need the largest area formed by any three distinct points. With `n ≤ 50` brute-forcing all triples `(O(n³))` is fine. The key is how to compute the area for a given triple — prefer a coordinate-native formula (shoelace / cross-product) over Heron (which needs distances and extra square roots).

## 💡 Approach (high level)

1. Iterate all triples of points `i < j < k`.
2. For each triple compute the triangle area from coordinates (shoelace / cross-product).
3. Track the maximum area and return it.

Why shoelace? fewer operations, integer arithmetic for intermediates (less rounding), no distance sqrts — more compact, faster, and numerically safer.

## ✅ Formula (shoelace / cross-product)

For points `p1=(x1,y1)`, `p2=(x2,y2)`, `p3=(x3,y3)`;

```ini
area = abs( x1*(y2 - y3) + x2*(y3 - y1) + x3*(y1 - y2) ) / 2
```

Equivalently (vector form):

```ini
area = 0.5 * abs( (x2-x1)*(y3-y1) - (x3-x1)*(y2-y1) )
```

Compute that for every triple and take the max.

## 🔍 Heron ↔ Shoelace — how they are equivalent

### Heron's formula:
Given side lengths `a`, `b`, `c`, let `s = (a + b + c) / 2`. Then

```ini
A = sqrt( s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c) )
```

Squaring and rearranging yields the identity

```ini
16 * Area^2 = (a + b + c) * (-a + b + c) * (a - b + c) * (a + b - c)
            = 2(a^2 b^2 + b^2 c^2 + c^2 a^2) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4).
```

### Shoelace / cross-product (coordinates):
With coordinates, define squared side lengths in terms of `(xi, yi)`:

```ini
a^2 = (x2 - x3)^2 + (y2 - y3)^2
b^2 = (x3 - x1)^2 + (y3 - y1)^2
c^2 = (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2
```

Substitute these `a^2, b^2, c^2` into the Heron identity for `16 * Area^2` and expand; you obtain exactly the same polynomial as the square of the shoelace expression:

```ini
(2*Area)^2 = [ (x2-x1)*(y3-y1) - (x3-x1)*(y2-y1) ]^2
```

So: **Heron** computes area from side lengths; **Shoelace** computes it directly from coordinates. When you express side lengths in coordinates and expand algebraically, the two squared-area expressions match — they are the same geometric quantity expressed in two ways.

**Practical takeaway**: Use shoelace when you have coordinates (more efficient & stable). Heron is equivalent but length-based; it’s educational to show they match, but not the best API for this problem.

## Code

```typescript []
function largestTriangleArea(points: number[][]): number {
    function getArea(point1: number[], point2: number[], point3: number[]): number{
        const side1Contribution: number = point1[0] * (point2[1] - point3[1]);
        const side2Contribution: number = point2[0] * (point3[1] - point1[1]);
        const side3Contribution: number = point3[0] * (point1[1] - point2[1]);
        return Math.abs(side1Contribution + side2Contribution + side3Contribution) / 2;
    }

    let maxArea: number = 0;
    for(let i=0; i<(points.length-2); i++){
        for(let j=(i+1); j<(points.length-1); j++){
            for(let k=(j+1); k<points.length; k++){
                maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, getArea(points[i], points[j], points[k]));
            }
        }
    }

    return maxArea;
};
```

## 📊 Complexity

- **Time**: `O(n³)` (check all triples; n ≤ 50 so fine).
- **Space**: `O(1)` extra.

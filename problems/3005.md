# ðŸ§© 3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency  

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Tags:** Hash Map, Array, Counting  
**Link:** [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-elements-with-maximum-frequency/)  

---

## ðŸ§  Intuition  
We want to find how many elements in the array appear with the **highest frequency**.  
For example, if two numbers both appear 3 times (maximum), then the answer is `3 + 3 = 6`.  

This suggests:  
1. Count frequencies.  
2. Find the maximum frequency.  
3. Add up occurrences of all numbers with that frequency.

## ðŸ’¡ Approach â€” Frequency Map  

1. Use a `Map` to count occurrences of each number.  
2. Track the maximum frequency during counting.  
3. Iterate the map again and sum the counts of numbers with frequency = `maxFrequency`.  

```javascript []
var maxFrequencyElements = function(nums) {
  if (!nums || nums.length === 0) return 0;

  const freq = new Map();
  let maxFrequency = 0;
  
  // Step 1 & 2: build and findout max Frequnecy
  for (const x of nums) {
    const newCount = (freq.get(x) || 0) + 1;
    freq.set(x, newCount);
    maxFrequnecy = Math.max(maxFrequnecy, newCount);
  }

  // Step 3: Sum counts of all elements that match maxFrequency
  let total = 0;
  for (const [key, value] of freq) {
    if (value === maxFrequency) total += maxFrequency;
  }

  return total;
};
```


## ðŸ“Š Complexity
- **Time**: O(n) â†’ one pass to count, one pass to sum.
- **Space**: O(n) â†’ frequency map in worst case (all numbers unique).

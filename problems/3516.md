# 🧩 Problem #3516 - Find Closest Person  

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Tags:** Math, Simulation  
**Link:** [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-closest-person/description/)  

---

## 🧠 Intuition  
We are given three positions on a number line:  
- `x` = Person 1,  
- `y` = Person 2,  
- `z` = Person 3 (fixed target).  

Both Person 1 and Person 2 move towards Person 3 at the **same speed**.  
So the winner is simply the one with the **smaller distance to z**.

## 💡 Approach — Distance Comparison  

1. Compute absolute distances:  
   - `dist1 = |x - z|` (Person 1 → Person 3)  
   - `dist2 = |y - z|` (Person 2 → Person 3)  
2. Compare:  
   - If `dist1 < dist2` → return `1`.  
   - If `dist1 > dist2` → return `2`.  
   - Else → return `0` (same distance).  

```javascript []
var findClosest = function(x, y, z) {
    const dist1 = Math.abs(x - z);
    const dist2 = Math.abs(y - z);
    if (dist1 === dist2) return 0;
    if (dist1 < dist2) return 1;
    return 2;
};
```

## 📊 Complexity

- **Time:** `O(1)` (just constant arithmetic).
- **Space:** `O(1)`.

## 🔍 Notes

- Simple absolute value check is enough — no need for loops or simulation.
- Because constraints are tiny `(1 ≤ x,y,z ≤ 100)`, performance is trivial.

## 💡 Intuition  

At first glance, we need to count all subarrays that are filled only with `0`s.  
A brute force idea is: generate all subarrays and check if they contain only zeros → but that’s $$O(n^2)$$, impossible for $$n = 10^5$$  

Key observation:  
- If you find a block of consecutive `0`s of length `n`, then the number of zero-filled subarrays inside it is: $$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$ 

So the problem reduces to: `find lengths of consecutive zero blocks and apply the formula`.

## 🛠 Approach  

We can solve this in two ways:  

### 1. Sliding Window (Formula per block)  
- Walk through the array.  
- Each time we hit a consecutive zero block of length `n`, add $$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$ to the answer.  

### 2. Incremental Counting (Cleaner)  
Instead of waiting until the end of the block, count subarrays **as we go**:  
- Maintain a counter `count` = length of the current zero streak.  
- For each `0` we see, do:  
  - `count++` (extend streak)  
  - `ans += count` (each new `0` forms `count` subarrays ending here).  
- Reset `count = 0` on non-zero.

This way, we’re building the formula step by step.  

This is called a `Triangular Number`, because if you arrange the series as dots it forms a triangle:

Each consecutive zero contributes to this `triangular growth of subarrays`.

So this problem is not just arrays → it’s a direct application of an `arithmetic series` in math.

## 📊 Complexity  

- **Time:** O(n) – one pass through the array.  
- **Space:** O(1) – only counters needed.

## ✍️ Code  

```javascript []
var zeroFilledSubarray = function(nums) {
    let ans = 0, count = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num === 0) {
            count++;
            ans += count;   // add all subarrays ending at this position
        } else {
            count = 0;      // reset streak
        }
    }
    return ans;
};
```

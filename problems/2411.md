## üß† Problem Understanding

We are given an array `nums`, and we need to return a new array `answer` of the same length such that:

- `answer[i]` is the **length of the smallest subarray starting at index `i`** that achieves the **maximum possible OR** among all subarrays starting at `i`.

### Example:

Input: `[1, 0, 2, 1, 3]`  
Let‚Äôs take index `1`:

Subarrays starting at index `1`:  
- `[0]` ‚Üí OR = 0  
- `[0, 2]` ‚Üí OR = 2  
- `[0, 2, 1]` ‚Üí OR = 3  
- `[0, 2, 1, 3]` ‚Üí OR = 3  

Maximum OR = `3`, smallest subarray to reach it = length `3`  
So `answer[1] = 3`.

---

## üîç Key Observations

1. Any number in the array is up to `10^9`, which means at most **32 bits** are relevant.
2. In a bitwise OR operation, **once a bit is set, it never gets unset**.
3. We can think of the array as a `N x 32` matrix of bits.
4. If we **process the array in reverse**, we can keep track of the **last-seen index** for each bit.  
   The furthest index needed to include a bit determines the length of the subarray.

---

## ‚úÖ Approach & Code

- Create a `bits[32]` array to store the **last index** where each bit was seen.
- Iterate `nums` from end to start.
- For each `nums[i]`, update the bit tracking.
- The **maximum distance** to any bit seen so far determines how far we need to go.
- Store this in `ans[i]`.

```js
var smallestSubarrays = function(nums) {
    const N = nums.length;
    const ans = new Array(N).fill(0);
    const bits = new Array(31).fill(0);

    // Iterate from the end
    for (let i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        const num = nums[i];

        // Update bit positions
        for (let j = 0; j < 32; j++) {
            if ((num & (1 << j)) > 0) {
                bits[j] = i;
            }
        }

        // Find the furthest bit index we need to include
        let oldestSetBit = Math.max(...bits);
        oldestSetBit = Math.max(oldestSetBit - i, 0);

        ans[i] = oldestSetBit + 1;
    }

  return ans;
};
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity

- `Time`	O(N √ó 32) ‚Üí O(N)
- `Space`	O(32) ‚Üí O(1)

## ‚úçÔ∏è Summary

This is a classic example of using bitwise properties and reverse traversal to optimize what appears to be a brute force problem.
The key insight is understanding that OR operations are cumulative, and you only need to track when each bit last appeared.
